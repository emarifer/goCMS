## Features ðŸš€

- [x] **Headless Architecture:** Adding pages, posts, or forms should all
  be done with easy requests to the API.
- [x] **Golang-Powered:** Leverage the performance and safety of one of the
  best languages in the market for backend development.
- [x] **SQL Database Integration:** Store your posts and pages in SQL databases for reliable and scalable data storage.
- [x] **Centralized HTTP error handling:** The user receives feedback about the Http errors that their actions may cause, through the use of middleware that centralizes the Http errors that occur.
- [ ] **Post**: We can add, update, and delete posts. Posts can be served
  through a unique URL.
- [ ] **Pages**: TODO.
- [ ] **Menus**: TODO
- [ ] **Live Reload** through the use of `air`.

## Installation

Ensure you have Golang installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.

```bash
go get -u github.com/emarifer/gocms
```

## Example - Running the App

After you've replaced the default template files with your prefered
template, simply build and start the app with the following commands.

```bash
go build
./gocms
```

This will start `goCMS` on `http://localhost:8080`. You can customize
the configuration by providing the necessary environment variables (settings/settings.yaml).

## Architecture

Currently, the architecture of `goCMS` is still in its early days.
The plan is to have two main applications: the public facing application
to serve the content through a website, and the admin application that
can be hidden, where users can modify the settings, add posts, pages, etc.
