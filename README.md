## Features ðŸš€

- [x] **Headless Architecture:** Adding pages, posts, or forms should all
  be done with easy requests to the API.
- [x] **Golang-Powered:** Leverage the performance and safety of one of the
  best languages in the market for backend development.
- [x] **SQL Database Integration:** Store your posts and pages in SQL databases for reliable and scalable data storage.
- [x] **Centralized HTTP error handling:** The user receives feedback about the Http errors that their actions may cause, through the use of middleware that centralizes the Http errors that occur.
- [x] **Caching HTML responses from endpoints:** Own implementation of an in-memory cache that stores HTML responses for 10 minutes in a map with mutex lock R/W access.
- [x] **Live Reload** through the use of `air`.
- [ ] **Post**: We can add, update, and delete posts. Posts can be served
  through a unique URL.
- [ ] **Pages**: TODO.
- [ ] **Menus**: TODO

>[!IMPORTANT]
>***The Go language uses [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) package to render HTML. In this application we have used the [a-h/templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) library instead. The main difference is that templ uses a generation step to compile the files .templ into Go code (as functions). This means that the templates are type-safe and can be checked at compile time. This amazing library implements a templating language (very similar to JSX) which allows you to write code almost identical to Go (with expressions, control flow, if/else, for loops, etc.) and have autocompletion. For all these reasons, calling these templates from the controllers side will always require the correct data, minimizing errors and thus increasing the security and speed of our coding.***

## Installation

Ensure you have Golang installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.

```bash
go get -u github.com/emarifer/gocms
```

## Example - Running the App

After you've replaced the default template files with your prefered
template, simply build and start the app with the following commands.

```bash
go build
./gocms
```

This will start `goCMS` on `http://localhost:8080`. You can customize
the configuration by providing the necessary environment variables (settings/settings.yaml).

## Architecture

Currently, the architecture of `goCMS` is still in its early days.
The plan is to have two main applications: the public facing application
to serve the content through a website, and the admin application that
can be hidden, where users can modify the settings, add posts, pages, etc.
